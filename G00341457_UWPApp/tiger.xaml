                People born in the year of the Tiger are brave, competitive, unpredictable, and self-confident. They are very charming and well-liked by others. But sometimes they are likely to be impetuous, irritable, and overindulged.
                With stubborn personalities and tough judgment, tigers work actively and boldly express themselves, and do things with a high-handed manner. They are authoritative and never go back on what they have said.
                With great confidence and indomitable fortitude, they can be competent leaders. They will not make preparations for anything, but they can handle anything that comes along.

                Tigers enjoy good health. They are active so they like to do various sports. Small illnesses, such as colds, coughs, and fever, are rarely experienced by Tigers.
                However, they should avoid excessive strenuous exercise, because some dangerous activities may lead to physical harm. When involved in outdoor excise, they should pay particular attention to warm-up exercise. Aerobic exercises, such as jogging, are suitable for keeping fit.
                Tigers are energetic and have great enthusiasm at work. When they feel exhausted after extended work, they need some relaxation to refresh themselves.
