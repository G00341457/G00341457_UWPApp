# Project Title

This is my third 3rd Year project for mobile applications 2. The objective of this assignment was to learn about creating UWP Apps which could then be sold on the app store. I decided to base mine on the zodiac calender as I felt this would make it relevant to a large audience. I also added he sound functionality to the pig page. However I could not gain access to the openweather API and simply left a placeholder in its place.

2.Run visual studio 2017
3.Run the project on localhost
### Prerequisites
